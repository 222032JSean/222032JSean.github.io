			<h3>LeBron James</h3>
			<img src="img/page3_2.png" alt="Lebron James" class="content2">
			<div id="page3content2" class="contents">
				<p>Nicknamed "King James", LeBron is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history, surpassing Kareem's record of 38,387 					points in the 2022-2023 season. He is widely regarded as one of the best players to ever step on the hardwood and is often 				compared to Michael Jordan in the GOAT debate. When he was in high school, he was heavily touted by the national media as 				a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, athleticism and playmaking abilities. He was expected to become a hall 				of famer when he was just 15 and at the same time many were also expecting him to fall short of that expectation. Drafted 				out of high school as the 1st overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers, he has since then exceeded all expectations. A few 				prominent events that occured in his career is "The Decision" when he announced on television his decision to leave him 				hometown team to join the Miami Heat and form the "Big 3" (LeBron, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh). He was heavily criticised for 				leaving the Cavaliers and forming a superteam to win a championship. However, after a 4-year stint with the Miami Heat and 				winning 2 championships, he returned to the Cavaliers once again in 2015 to bring a championship to his hometown team. In 				2016, after being in a 3-1 deficit against the Golden State Warriors (who had just attain the best record in NBA history 				of 73-9 in the regular season) in the NBA Finals series, LeBron and the Cavaliers made one of the greatest comebacks in 				sports history, winning the series 4-3 and finally bringing a championship to his hometown team. "The Block" in the Game 7 				of the Finals when he blocked Andre Iguodala's possible gane-clinching layup is also considered one of the greatest 					moments in the history of NBA.</p>

			<div id="page3content3" class="contents">
				<p>Well-known for his "mamba mentality" and work etiquette, Kobe is the most hardworking and one of the best players to 				play the game of basketball.
